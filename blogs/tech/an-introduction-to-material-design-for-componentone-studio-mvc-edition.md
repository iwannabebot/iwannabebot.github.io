Material design is a versatile set of guidelines that support the best practices of user interface design. It provides uniform specifications for themes, layouts, animation, components, and typography to let you express your brand with confidence. Material design is inspired by the physical world and its texture — how they reflect light, and cast shadows with a minimalist and clean approach.
Google announced Material and it’s specification in mid-2014, defining Material as based on paper and ink with advanced implementations. As of today, all of Google’s mobile applications for Android have applied Material.

## How to use Material Design with ComponentOne MVC Controls
[ComponentOne MVC](https://www.grapecity.com/en/aspnet-mvc) controls lets you add Material design look and feel by using [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/started/index.html#download). It does not rely on any JS framework. It only takes two steps to add material support in your application. Our material theme should work in all evergreen browsers alike, with full support in Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari. For older browsers like IE9, we degrade to CSS only.
There are two ways to use our inbuilt Material themes: with HTML/tag helpers and with our theme builder.

    public Connection Connection { get; set; }
    public void Dispose() {
        Connection = null;
